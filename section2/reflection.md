## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I find myself somewhere in between. I'm usually not afraid to ask questions even if they feel really dumb, but sometimes I get stuck down the rabbit hole trying to figure it out myself and don't realize how long its taking. Like the last blog post pointed out, you might feel dumb asking a question, but you will feel even more dumb after spending so much time on something that ends up being a simple fix. Naturally, we all want to avoid feeling dumb and we think figuring things out on our own will help us do that. However, these blog posts helped me realize that feeling dumb is probably unavoidable, but I don't have to let it be embarrassing or define me as a developer. I feel a lot more comfortable asking questions knowing that a lot of other people feel the exact same way, and these blog posts provided some great advice on how to ask questions well.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

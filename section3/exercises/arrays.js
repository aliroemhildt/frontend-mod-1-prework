//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Horse");

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals[4]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ['avocado', 'egg', 'mango', 'bread'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(food.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
food.push('broccoli');
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
food.pop();
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
food.push('apple');
food.push('cheese');
food.push('chocolate');
console.log(food);


// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift();

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Gmail - if your emails are grouped into different labels/inboxes, there would be a different array for each inbox with a specific set of emails.
var inbox = ['email1','email2','email3'];
var starred = ['email4', 'email5'];
var spam = ['email6','email7'];

// 2: Netfilx - For a TV show, all of the episodes are separated into different arrays for each season.
var season1 = ['S1E1','S1E2','S1E3','S1E4','S1E5'];

// 3: Amazon - your shopping cart on the amazon website could be an array. Each time you add an item to your cart, you add a new item to the array.
var shoppingCart = ['batteries','phone case','book'];


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// Check first condition: percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// If first condition is met, print the message 'You can call an uber!' to console
  console.log('You can call an uber!')
// If first condition is not met, check second condition: hasCharger is true and chargerType is equal to 'car'
}  else if (hasCharger && chargerType == "car") {
// If second condition is met, print the message 'You can call an uber!' to console
  console.log('You can call an uber!')
// If first and second conditions are not met, print the message 'Sorry, you can not call an uber...' to console
} else {
  console.log('Sorry, you can not call an uber...')
};

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ

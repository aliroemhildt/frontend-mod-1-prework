## Section 1 Reflection

1. **How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?**

This article made learning a new skill feel much more approachable. These are 6 steps that everyone can do to become a better learner, because learning is a lot more about your effort and mindset than your inherit intelligence.

From this list, I feel like I already view learning as a process rather than and end goal, and I have an open, growth-mindset. I also have used the pomodoro technique before and find it really helps me stay focused.

I hope to incorporate more reading into my daily routine to supplement my learning. I also had some pretty unhealthy habits in college, prioritizing school work over my physical and mental health. So, I will be working really hard to make health and wellness as high of a priority as my work during Turing. I also want to challenge myself to try to help teach my peers as much as I can.

2. **What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.**
Number - any number, including negatives and decimals
String - letters and characters that are between quotes
Boolean - true/false, allows us to ask a program yes/no questions

3. **How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**
`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. **What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?**
```JavaScript
// you can comment a single line or part of a line with two backslashes
/* you can comment a single line, part of a line, or many lines using this notation at the beginning and end of your comment */
```

5. **In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?**
A variable is a name that we make up that represents whatever information we tell it to. Then we can use this name in our code.  

6. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?**
In the Netflix app, there would be a variable for the name of specific episode (string), the length of that episode (number), and a variable for if you have watched that episode or not (boolean).

7. **In your own words, explain what concatenation is.**
Concatenation is combining multiple strings together into one string with the (+) operator. You can also can combine other data types with strings, to make one string (the other data types are converted to a string).

8. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?**
In an email subscription, developers have a variable for your name that is a string, and a generic greeting variable that is a string. They would concatenate these into one string to create a personalized greeting for each user that receives the email.

9. **What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)**
- For type coercion, when would data types get converted to a string vs a number vs a boolean?
- Are there certain scenarios when you would always choose concatenation or interpolation? Is it just a preference which one you use? Or is interpolation preferred since it is easer to read?
